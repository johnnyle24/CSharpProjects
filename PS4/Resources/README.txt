My solution involves referencing PS2 and PS3. You can create it by creating an AbstractSpreadsheet.
An interesting thing to note that is most likely common on a majority of student codes is that

A method used to determine if a string is valid is used as a private helper method.

Two friends, Java and C, are sitting in a bar late one night having a chat. Intrigued by their exotic languages, a steady stream of guys have been walking over to hit on them. However, they're all paying a lot more attention to Java, leaving poor C stuck in a loop back and forth to the bar.
After a few more iterations, C's feeling a little tipsy. Eventually, she plucks up some courage and asks the next guy why he's so keen on Java and not her.
He replies: "It’s nothing personal C, really. I just prefer girls with a little more class."
